A peak at the different classes of the data

	- wide variety in quality and color and size of images
	- surprisingly difficult to distinguish even between 0 and 4 classes by hand!

	-descriptions of different levels of classes and examples

	level 0 (healthy)
		crisp images 
			164_right
			19520_left
		glares
			29055_right
			32459_right
		off-centered
			27708_left
		light lines
			36222_left
		dark spot
			33699_left
		white splotch
			13817_right
		splotches
			16749_left

	level 4 (rampant disease)
		splotchiness
			217_right
			43199_right
		dark clouds
			13222_left
		not always splotchy
			40917_left

Looking at training set image sizes and compression

	median size :		1.16 MB
	median pixel height : 	2592
	median pixel width :	3888

	* the file "trainLabels_withsize.csv" has these measurements for each training example. 

	- tried just shrinking the (pixel) sizes of these images (in Mac Preview application) to see what compression was possible that way. After playing with some examples that had the "splotches" we'd want to preserve in the images, I think even 320 X 240 pixels OR 640 X 480 pixels still preserves the main features of these images, which shrinks the files to around 10 - 60 KB in size (almost a factor of 100 from the median original size!) 

	if we can get 30KB images and want to keep the training set no bigger than 300MB we can use 10,000 images!
