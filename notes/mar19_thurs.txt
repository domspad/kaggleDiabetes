About the data:

	90 GB
	36,000 training examples
	36,000 test
	each image ~1.5 GB 

	for processing purposes need training set ~100MB
		so without processing --> 450X smaller

	distribution of training labels (0=healthy,1,2,3,4=retinopathy!)
		0 	25810
		1 	2443
		2 	5292	<--- weird more 2's than 1's
		3 	873
		4 	708
	
		i.e. skewed classes ... only roughly 4% images have score 3 or 4 
		and even class '2' seems hard to judge as having blotches


Goal 1: Preprocessing -- how small can we get the photos while still retaining necessary blotches?

	greyscale (~2X smaller)
	shrink 
	crop 
	industry techniques?
	

Goal 2: Preprocessing -- what is best format for the images to be fed into machine learning algorithms?

	centering
	flipping left/right to be same side
	
Questions:
	
	where do the blotches show up?
	what are the most salient features to distinguish between the classes
